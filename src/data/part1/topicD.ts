              (Fewer Rules) Well, my university has fewer rules than my high school. They trust us to be responsible. We don't have to wear a uniform, and the class schedule is more flexible. There are still rules about exams and plagiarism, of course.`

              <br/><br/>
              (No) No, I don't think so. Too many rules can make students feel stressed and less creative. I think it's better to give students some freedom and trust them to make good choices. This helps them become more independent.`

              (No) No, I can't say that I have. Most of my teachers were good at their jobs, but I wouldn't call them exceptionally dedicated. They taught the class and did what was required, but they didn't go above and beyond.`

              (Fewer) I prefer to have fewer rules. I like having more freedom. When there are too many rules, I feel like I can't be myself. I believe students learn better when they are given more trust and responsibility.`

              (No) No, I don't think so. I believe some rules are necessary for a school to function. Without rules, the classroom could be very chaotic. It would be very difficult for the teacher to teach and for the students to learn.`
